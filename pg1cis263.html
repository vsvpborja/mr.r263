<h1> Final project for CIS 263 for Mr. Carlos Rodriguez</h1>

    <body>
        <p>THe purpose of our program is to deliver a Point of Sale system for pancakes. Any breakfast or diner would be able to buy our software and be able to use it to take Pancake orders.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>The program begins with presenting the ingredients available like chocalate chip, strawberries, etc. and from there you are able to choose how many pancakes you would like. Once you're done choosing your toppings and the quantity of panackes you would like; you will be asked if your order is correct and if it is then you'll reach the end of the program. If for some reason the order is incorrect you will be taken back to the begining of our program and begin anew so that your order can be taken correctly. </p>
